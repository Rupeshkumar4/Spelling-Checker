# Spelling-Checker
<h2>Spell check is a software tool for correcting spelling. It's available in word processing programs, email programs, cell phones, and a variety of other applications, such as blogs and forums. Spell check lets you know when words are misspelled, corrects misspelled words as you type, and allows you to search a whole document for misspelled words.</h2>
